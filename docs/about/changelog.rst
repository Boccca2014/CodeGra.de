Version *Next*
---------------

**Released**: TBD

**Features**

- Improve plagiarism document rendering `(#1335)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1335>`__. Matching blocks of
  code can now be rendered side by side, the amount of context lines before and
  after each match is configurable, and it is possible to export to a docx
  file.

**Fixes**

- Fix AutoTest result being in state "done" while it has steps that are in
  state "waiting to be started" `(#1349)

Version LowVoltage
-------------------

**Released**: April 15th, 2020

You can now view assignment statistics on the Analytics Dashboard, giving you
insight into student performance. Students can now also comment on their own
code, and they can reply to comments placed by teachers.

**Features**

- Analytics dashboard (`#1300
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1300>`__). The analytics
  dashboard is a new page with various statistics about an assignment. It gives
  teachers insights in how students are performing on the assignment and where the
  assignment may be improved.
- Inline feedback replies (`#1305
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1305>`__). It is now possible
  to reply to inline feedback, which makes distance learning easier to do with
  CodeGrade. This update also adds markdown formatting to inline feedback, and
  notifies you when you have received new replies.
- Contact student button (`#1307
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1307>`__). This makes it
  possible for teachers to send emails to students of a submission, or to
  multiple students in a course.


**Updates**

- Make usernames case insensitive (`#1310
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1310>`__). This reduces
  ambiguity in which user you are dealing with, as well as making it easier to
  login because you do not have to remember if you used an uppercase or not
  when you registered.
- Various internal improvements (`#1244
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1244>`__). This makes it easier
  to improve CodeGrade in the future.
- Plagiarism support for newer versions of Java. You can now use the Plagiarism
  checker for newer versions of Java.

**Fixes**

- Make sure that empty markdown files show a useful error `(#1244)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1244>`__.

Version Knoet.3

  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1246>`__: It is now possible to
  render HTML pages inside CodeGrade.
- Make the HomeGrid easier and faster to use `(#1292)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1292>`__: We now sort the
  courses on the HomeGrid based on the creation date of the courses, and courses
  with duplicate names can now be more easily identified as the creation date of
  the course will be appended to the name.


**Updates**

- Upgrade bootstrap-vue `(#1259)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1259>`__.
- Show confirmation when rubric has rows without item with 0 points `(#1287)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1287>`__.
- Update threshold when relative time starts using days `(#1290)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1290>`__.

- Give a better indication when an AutoTest step is hidden `(#1286)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1286>`__.
- Various performance improvements `(#1278)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1278>`__: We've increased
  performance of various API routes, and added pagination and infinite scrollers
  to the HomeGrid, Submissions list and users manager to improve the first
  render speed.
- Start using timezones everywhere when dealing with datetimes `(#1257)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1257>`__.

**Fixes**

- Do not discard changed rubric viewer when saving general feedback `(#1283)

  changed rubric the changes in the rubric were discarded.
- Fix downloading submissions with reserved chars in their name `(#1289)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1289>`__.
- Fix student count in submission list `(#1282)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1282>`__.

Version 1.19.0 (Knoet.2)
-------------------------

**Released**: January 30th, 2020

You can now add Continuous Rubric Categories, which can score anywhere on a
continuous scale and work great with AutoTest. You can also now set student
submission limits and a cool off period.

**Features**

- Continuous rubric categories `(#1235)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1235>`__: this new type of
  rubric category can be used to give points anywhere on a scale from 0 to a
  configurable amount of points. This behavior maps better to certain types of
  AutoTest categories, such as categories containing only "capture points"
  steps. Rubrics can contain a mix of discrete and continuous categories and
  both can still be used for AutoTest.
- Make it possible to limit the amount of submissions `(#1237)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1237>`__: the amount of
  submissions can be limited in two ways:

  1. A maximum total amount of submissions for an assignment.
  2. A cool-off period: an amount of time a student must wait before they can
     submit again.
- Separate feedback permissions `(#1234)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1234>`__: the
  `can_see_grade_before_done` permission was used for all types of feedback
  students would get. New `can_see_user_feedback_before_done` and
  `can_see_linter_feedback_before_done` permissions make it possible to show
  these types of feedback before an assignment is set to done while still
  hiding others.

**Minor updates**

- Add warning when creating a wrong external tool link in Canvas `(#1248)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1248>`__: Canvas has multiple
  ways to integrate external tools, some of which leave CodeGrade unable to
  communicate correctly with it. This update displays a message when this
  happens.

**Fixes**

- Use the most privileged LTI role available
  `(#1248) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1248>`__.
- Fix float matching for AutoTest capture points test
  `(#1251) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1251>`__.

  the rubric.
- Add course registration link `(#1207) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1207>`__:
  for standalone courses, you can let users register via a unique URL. You can
  set this up on the Course Management Page.

**Minor updates**

- Update git instructions `(#1221) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1221>`__:
  the git instructions have been updated to be more compatible with git GUIs. We've
  also added a button to the last step to check if submitting works correctly.
- Stop persisting access tokens in LTI `(#1216) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1216>`__:
  you're now only logged in persistently when pressing the "New Tab" button. This fixes some issues
  where users were always logged in via LTI.

**Fixes**

- Set groups of user in AutoTest run `(#1223) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1223>`__.
- Fix the default configurations for Checkstyle `(#1224) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1224>`__.

  this makes it possible for students to automatically hand in submissions by pushing to
  GitHub or GitLab. Each student gets a unique URL, SSH public key and secret which
  can be used to configure a deploy key and webhook.
- Add AutoTest output directory `(#1188) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1188>`__:

Version 1.10.3 (JungleJoy.2)
-----------------------------

**Released**: August 28th, 2019

It is now significantly more efficient to run AutoTest or Continuous Feedback by
a big improvement in our back-end. Additionally, our latest update adds further
improvements to CodeGrade and fixes several minor and rare bugs.

**Features**

-  Use multiple runners
   `(#1037) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1037>`__: make
   AutoTest or Continuous Feedback more efficient by allowing multiple runners
   to work on one run.
-  Only show latest submissions by default
   `(#1040) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1040>`__: make
   loading of submission(s) pages more efficient by only loading latest
   submissions by default, which especially is a problem with continuous
   feedback which can cause high amounts of attempts per student. Additionally
   adds an improved dropdown to switch between submissions of one student.


**Minor updates**

-  Improve popovers for locked rubric rows
   `(#1016) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1016>`__:
   improves presentation of rubrics on more pages and adds popover to the whole
   rubric instead of only the lock icon.
-  Increase indentation of files in the file tree
   `(#1022) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1022>`__.
-  Improve scrolling to match near end in plagiarism detail
   `(#1024) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1024>`__: make it
   possible to align plagiarism matches even if one is near the bottom of the
   file.
-  Remove confirmation to delete feedback when FeedbackArea is empty
   `(#1034) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1034>`__: make it
   quicker to remove empty inline comments by removing confirmation dialog.
-  Use a tail of output use for custom output matching
   `(#1036) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1036>`__: capture
   points tests have a cap on the output of the command. Now the points are
   always captured from the tail of this output.
-  Minor AutoTest setup script improvements
   `(#1041) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1041>`__: make
   Continuous Feedback setup script output visible to students and improve the
   setup scripts popover texts.
-  Move Jplag languages to the config
   `(#1043) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1043>`__: adding
   new languages to our plagiarism detection is easier now, as it does now not
   need modifications in the CodeGrade source code.
-  Add pagination to the AutoTest run overview `(#1045)
   <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/1045>`__: if there are too
   many results for an AutoTest run the results will be paginated, which
   decreases loading time and makes the page responsive.

**Fixes**

  to have the same TAs grade the same students over the duration of the entire
  course.

- Confirm clearing a rubric `(#833)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/833>`__: Instead of requiring

  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/790>`__
  `(#828) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/828>`__
  `(#806) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/806>`__: Buttons will
  not change size anymore, and when an error occurs the button will wait for
  the user to close the message, instead of the error message disappearing
  after a few seconds, not giving the user a chance to read the entire thing.
- Change sidebar login icon `(#830)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/830>`__: The icon was ugly and
  its meaning not very obvious.

  take quite some time but didn't show the progress until they quit
  successfully or crashed.

  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/812>`__.
- Make it possible to download the plagiarism log `(#802)

- Add warning on permission management page `(#801)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/801>`__: When permissions are
  changed it shows a notification that the page must be reloaded for the
  changes to take effect.
- Add a release notifier on the home grid `(#787)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/787>`__: Whenever a new version
  of CodeGrade is installed, a notification will be shown on the home page with
  a link to this changelog.

  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/835>`__.

  them between assignments, and submit as a group. Groups can be given
  a nice name, that is easily remembered by the TA.
- Add support for 7zip as archive format `(#738)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/738>`__
- Make late submissions stand out `(#739)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/739>`__: Submissions that have
  been handed in after the deadline are highlighted in the submissions list.
- Make it possible to display IPython notebooks `(#742)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/742>`__: CodeGrade now renders
  handed in IPython notebooks in the web interface instead of showing a JSON
  blob. Additionally, markdown files are also rendered. Teachers can place
  comments in both types of files, as well as on image files now. This also
  adds a message when a file does not end in a newline character.

**Minor updates**

- Show message when uploaded file is empty `(#766)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/766>`__: When a file is empty,
  it wouldn't show up at all in the code viewer. This changes it to show
  a message, indicating that the file is empty.
- Make the user selector more clear `(#752)
  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/752>`__: The user selector now

- Make sure it is possible to ignore single files `(#767)

  <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/748>`__

  apply. Please see the documentation for more details

   `(#710) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/710>`__: When
   linting lines with errors didn’t show indentation.
-  Fix dark special holiday logo.
   `(#711) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/711>`__
-  Make it impossible to upload too large archives
   `(#709) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/709>`__: This
   makes it way harder for users to bypass our restrictions to upload
   very large archives.
-  Various internal fixes and improvements.
   `(#716) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/716>`__
-  Don’t apply “mine” filter when assigning first submission to self
   `(#717) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/717>`__: When
   no submission had an assignee and you assigned yourself it filtered
   all other submissions directly.
-  Make sure the grade is updated when rubric is.
   `(#731) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/731>`__

   `(#732) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/732>`__

Version 1.0.22 (HereBeMonsters.2)
----------------------------------

**Released**: November 21st, 2018

**Features**

-  Enforce minimal password strength
   `(#683) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/683>`__
   `(#697) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/697>`__:
   CodeGrade now enforces a minimum password strength for all users. A
   warning is also shown if a user logs in with a password that doesn't
   adhere to the current requirements. We recommend all users to update
   their passwords if they receive such a warning.
-  Update course and assignment name on LTI launch
   `(#682) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/682>`__: If
   the name of a course or assignment changes within your LMS this
   change is now copied in CodeGrade.
-  Do lti launch on grade result
   `(#681) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/681>`__: When
   viewing new grades this will trigger an LTI launch. This means you
   will always be logged-in in CodeGrade with the current LMS user.
-  Show a loader instead of the delete button for plagiarism checks that
   are still running.
   `(#700) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/700>`__

**Fixes**

-  Only show register button when the feature is enabled.
   `(#679) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/679>`__
-  Make it possible to create PDF manuals.
   `(#687) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/687>`__
-  Fix plagiarism detail viewer
   `(#690) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/690>`__:
   Because of a misplaced bracket it was not possible to view plagiarism
   cases.
-  Always do an initial grade passback
   `(#692) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/692>`__: This
   reverts a change in version 1.0.0 which caused Canvas to not remove
   CodeGrade assignments from the todo list of students. By doing a LTI
   passback when students hand-in a submission the assignment should be
   removed from their todo list.
-  Various small logging fixes.
   `(#693) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/693>`__
-  Redact emails of other users
   `(#695) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/695>`__: This
   is a minor **breaking change**. When serializing a user an ``email``
   key was always sent including the email of every user. With this
   change the ``email`` key is only sent with the extended serialization
   of a user, and the value is changed to ``'<REDACTED>'`` for every
   user except the currently logged-in user. This prevents people in the
   same course from seeing each others email.
-  Improve speed of plagiarism route
   `(#694) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/694>`__: By
   using the database in a more efficient way this route should become
   about twice as fast!
-  Various styling fixes.
   `(#701) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/701>`__
   `(#703) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/703>`__

   information see our documentation.

-  Make it possible give grades higher than ten `(#500) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/500>`_: Teachers can now
   indicate that students can receive a grader higher than 10 for an
   assignment, making it possible to create assignments with bonus
   points in CodeGrade. When using within LTI this requires a new LTI
   parameter.

   You should add the following to the ``<blti:custom>`` section of your
   canvas LTI config for CodeGrade:

   .. code:: xml

      <lticm:property name="custom_canvas_points_possible">
        $Canvas.assignment.pointsPossible
      </lticm:property>

**Minor updates**

-  Change homepage to login screen `(#480) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/480>`_ `(#496) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/496>`_ `(#501) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/501>`_ `(#557) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/557>`_ `(#616) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/616>`_:
   The homepage has been improved to show all your courses and
   assignments at a glance when logged in.
-  Use new logos `(#481) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/481>`_ `(#506) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/506>`_: This updates our logo to the newest and
   greatest version!
-  Allow .tar.xz archives to be uploaded `(#492) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/492>`_: This further improves
   the flexibility CodeGrade gives students when handing in submissions.
-  Fix infinite loop overview mode `(#477) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/477>`_: In some combinations of
   permissions loading the overview mode resulted in an infinite loader.
-  Add general feedback tab to overview mode `(#523) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/523>`_: This further
   decreases the chance that students will miss any of their feedback.
-  Improve speed of diffing by using another library `(#529) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/529>`_: Viewing the
   diff between two large files is a lot faster!
-  Remove the option to automatically generate keys `(#554) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/554>`_: It is no
   longer possible to generate the ``secret_key`` or ``lti_secret_key``
   configuration options. Please update your config accordingly.
-  Rewrite snippets manager `(#551) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/551>`_: This rewrite should make creating,
   using, deleting and updating snippets faster and more reliable.
-  Drastically improve the experience of CodeGrade on mobile `(#558) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/558>`_: It
   is now way easier to use CodeGrade on mobile.
-  Filter users in the user selector `(#553) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/553>`_: When selecting users (when
   uploading for others, or adding to courses) only show users will be
   shown that can be selected.
-  Improve handling of LTI `(#561) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/561>`_ `(#588) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/588>`_: A complete rewrite of LTI
   backend handling. This should improve the stability of passbacks by a
   lot. This also guarantees that the submission date in Canvas and
   CodeGrade will match exactly. This also adds a new convenience route
   ``/api/v1/lti/?lms=Canvas`` to get lti config for the given LMS
   (Canvas only supported at the moment).
-  Add items to the sidebar conditionally `(#578) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/578>`_ `(#580) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/580>`_ `(#600) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/600>`_: Depending
   on what page you are you will get extra items in the sidebar to help
   quick navigation. Currently plagiarism cases and submissions are
   added depending on the page.
-  Start caching submissions `(#643) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/643>`_ `(#636) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/636>`_: Submissions are cached in the
   front-end so changing between the codeviewer and submissions list is
   now way quicker.
-  Ensure all rubric rows have a maximum amount of >= 0 points `(#579) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/579>`_: It
   is no longer allowed to have rows in a rubric where the maximum
   possible score is < 0. If you needed this to create rubrics with
   bonus categories simply use the ‘Max points’ option in the rubric
   editor. All existing rubrics are not changed.

**Fixes**

-  Various small bugs in the sidebar
-  Add a minimum duration on the permission manager loaders `(#521) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/521>`_: This
   makes it clearer that permissions are actually updated.
-  Throw an API error when a rubric row contains an empty header `(#535) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/535>`_:
   This is a backwards incompatible API change, however it doesn’t
   change anything for the frontend.
-  Fix broken matchFiles function `(#528) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/528>`_ `(#550) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/550>`_: This fixes a bug that
   files changed inside a directory would not show up in the overview
   mode.
-  Fix horizontal overflow on codeviewer `(#518) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/518>`_: The codeviewer would
   sometimes overflow creating a vertical scrollbar when displaying
   files containing a large amount of consecutive tabs.
-  Check if an assignment is loaded before getting its course `(#549) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/549>`_: In
   some rare cases LTI launches would fail be cause assignments were not
   loaded correctly.
-  Add structured logging setup `(#546) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/546>`_: This makes it easier to follow
   requests and debug issues.
-  Fix general feedback line wrapping `(#570) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/570>`_: Giving long lines as
   general feedback should be displayed correctly to the user now.
-  Add manage assignment button to submission list `(#574) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/574>`_: It is now
   possible to easily navigate to the manage assignment page from the
   submissions list.
-  Start using enum to store permissions in the backend `(#571) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/571>`_: Most
   routes will be faster by this design change.
-  Improve filetree design `(#599) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/599>`_ `(#611) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/611>`_ `(#587) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/587>`_: It is now easier to spot
   additions, changes and deletion directly in the filetree.
-  Add ``<noscript>`` tag `(#613) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/613>`_: An error message will be displayed when
   javascript is disabled.
-  Improve speed of filetree operations `(#623) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/623>`_: Loading large filetrees
   is now way quicker by using smarter data-structures.
-  Add health route `(#593) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/593>`_: It is now possible to more easily monitor the
   health of your CodeGrade instance.
-  Fix fontSize & contextAmount on submission page `(#633) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/633>`_: Sometimes the
   fields would show up empty, this shouldn’t happen anymore!
-  Replace submitted symlinks with actual files `(#627) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/627>`_: When a student
   uploads an archive with symlinks the student is warned and all
   symlinks are replaced by files explaining that the original files
   were symlinks but that those are not supported by CodeGrade.
-  Fix grade history popover boundary `(#625) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/625>`_: The grade history would
   sometimes show up outside the screen, but no more!
-  Make it impossible to submit empty archives `(#622) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/622>`_: A error is shown
   when a student tries to submit an archive without files.
-  Show toast when local-storage doesn’t work `(#607) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/607>`_: When a user has no
   local-storage available a warning is shown so the user knows that
   their experience might be sub-optimal.
-  Show author of general feedback and line comments `(#564) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/564>`_ `(#605) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/605>`_: The
   author of all general feedback and line comments is displayed to the
   user. Only users with the ``can_see_assignee`` permission will see
   authors.
-  Justify description popover text `(#596) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/596>`_: The text in descriptions is
   now justified and their popups will only show when the ‘i’ is
   clicked.
-  Only submit rubric items or normal grade `(#589) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/589>`_: In some rare cases
   overriding rubrics would result in a race condition, resulting in
   wrong case.
-  Redesign the download popover on the submission page `(#595) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/595>`_: This new
   design looks way better, but you tell us!
-  Only show overview mode when you have permission to see feedback
   `(#563) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/563>`_: When you don’t have permission to see feedback the overview
   mode will never be shown.
-  Various other performance improvements `(#566) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/566>`_: We always strive for
   the best performance possible, and again in this release we increased
   the performance of CodeGrade!
-  Make sure codeviewer is full width on medium pages `(#591) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/591>`_: This makes
   it easier to review and display code on smaller screens.
-  Use custom font in toasted actions `(#614) <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.de/pull/614>`_: It is now always possible
   to close toasts, even when your font cannot display ‘✖’.
