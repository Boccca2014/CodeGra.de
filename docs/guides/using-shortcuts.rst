Using shortcuts
======================================================

For maximum efficiency CodeGrade has support for shortcuts. In most input fields
in CodeGrade you can save using **CTRL+ENTER**. For example, after writing an
inline feedback comment, you can press **CTRL+ENTER** to save your feedback quickly.
With **TAB**, you can cycle through options and go to next input fields.

- **CTRL+ENTER**: Saving an input field.

- **TAB**: Cycle through options (e.g. snippets) and going to next input fields.
