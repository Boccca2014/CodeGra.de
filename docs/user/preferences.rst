Settings and Site Preferences
==============================
CodeGrade offers a variety of options to modify the site and the `Codeviewer <codeviewer.html#settings-tab>`__
to your needs. These are, in addition to options to manage account information, discussed in this chapter.

Site Preferences
-----------------
General site preferences can be found in the *user* menu. Here the appearance of CodeGrade can be personalised.
Two CodeGrade and `Codeviewer <codeviewer.html#settings-tab>`__ themes are available:

* **Light** (*default*): Light background with dark text.
* **Dark**: Dark background with light text.

.. note:: Research suggests dark characters on light are better for focus. However light characters on dark can be preferred in dark surroundings.

In addition, font size of the `Codeviewer <codeviewer.html#settings-tab>`__ can be adjusted here.

.. warning:: Site preferences are saved in the browser and not in the user account. (Snippets are however saved in the user account!)

Account Information Settings
------------------------------
Personal account information can also be modified in the *user* menu. Additionally your snippets can be managed here too.

Personal Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under the *User Info* tab the full name and e-mail address can be changed. Changes are automatically applied after pressing the submit button.

.. note:: It is not possible to change your username after creating an account.

Change Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your old password is required in order to change your password. Press submit to change your password on CodeGrade.

.. note:: CodeGrade recommends using a different (secure) password for each website you use.

LMS Account Passwords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you do yet have a password because your CodeGrade account was
created using your learning management system (e.g. Canvas), you should use our *reset password* dialog. More information on this process
can be found by clicking the :fa:`info` icon next to the *Old Password* field. Your password can now be reset following the link sent by e-mail.

.. note:: If your e-mail address of your CodeGrade LMS account is incorrect, please change your e-mail address in your LMS account and use the *here* button in the :fa:`info` window to force CodeGrade to change the e-mail address to the current LMS' e-mail address.

Snippet Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Snippets are line feedback shortcuts. A line feedback comment can be saved as snippet and given a short name, which can then be used to
autocomplete this full line feedback comment in future uses. Snippets are personal and saved to your CodeGrade account to be used over all
courses and assignments. More information on the usage of snippets in the Codeviewer can be found `here <codeviewer.html#snippets>`__.

The snippet manager allows you to edit (using the :fa:`pen` button), delete (using the red :fa:`multiply` button) and add snippets. When in
edit mode, be sure to save your snippet using the :fa:`save` button to apply your changes or cancel your edit using the :fa:`ban` button.

.. note:: Use the search bar to search for (parts of) snippet names or full comments.

Manage Site
------------
Site administrators have the option to manage site-wide permissions using the
:fa:`tachometer` button (only visible to site administrators). More information
on the permissions is found `here <permissions.html#site-permissions>`__.

.. note:: Please `contact <../about/contact.html>`__ us for specific feature requests or site management.
