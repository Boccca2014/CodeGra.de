Codeviewer
===============
The CodeGrade Codeviewer is the online grading and reviewing environment especially
designed for programming assignments. It provides teachers with numerous tools
to make reviewing and grading more convenient and efficient and displays feedback and
grade in a more intuitive way to the students. Additionally it provides students an
intuitive environment to receive feedback in.

The Codeviewer is displayed after navigating to an individual submission. These can be
found via the 'Assignments' menu and selecting the assignment to review.

Codeviewer for Teachers
-------------------------
The basic components of the Codeviewer are the Codeviewer itself and the file browser, which
displays all the files handed in by the student.

.. note:: Supported archives handed in are automatically extracted by CodeGrade.

The Codeviewer displays the selected code with correct highlighting, optional whitespace characters and line numbering. It
furthermore supports PDF and image files. Optional feedback
generated by linters is indicated by red line numbers, the feedback generated by the linters can be displayed by a mouse over. The
Codeviewer displays the selected file from the file browser, which shows an hierarchical overview of all submitted files.

Files indicated with an asterisk have a teacher revision (optionally created
with the `filesystem <https://fs-docs.codegra.de>`__). If available, the tabs above the
hierarchical file view can be used to toggle between the student revision,
teacher revision and the *diff* mode.


Additional features in the Codeviewer aid the grading and reviewing process. These features are described below.

Line feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oftentimes, feedback for specific lines or blocks of code is wanted to make specific errors clear to students.
CodeGrade enables this with the addition of line feedback.

Feedback on a specific line can be given by clicking on this line of code in the Codeviewer. Feedback can be
written in the appeared dialog and saved with the :fa:`check` button. Clicking on previously placed line
for line feedback displays this same dialog and clicking the :fa:`times` button will remove the comment.

Snippets
^^^^^^^^^
It is not unusual that identical line feedback comments apply to multiple cases or students. Snippets can be used
to efficiently but thoroughly cover all these reoccurring comments. Snippets are named saved comments that can be quickly added in the reviewing process.

.. note:: Snippets are saved to your personal profile and are not limited to courses or assignments.

New snippets can be added through the `profile
page <preferences.html>`__ and via the :fa:`plus` button in the line of line feedback dialog. The latter makes it possible to save existing line for line
feedback comments. After clicking this button the snippet can be named and saved for future use. To use your saved snippet, simply type
in the given name and press the TAB keyboard key to autocomplete it to the saved comment.

.. note:: It is in most cases recommended to use a short keyword for the snippet.

Overview mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The overview mode can be enabled with :fa:`binoculars` or is automatically presented after the assignment is set to the 'done' state.
As its name suggests, this mode provides an overview of the submission, given line feedback and changes made in the teacher revision.
The line feedback and changes made in the teacher revision are sorted per file and are presented with a block of
code around the feedback or change.

Rubrics
~~~~~~~~~
If a rubric is available for the assignment it can be found under the :fa:`th` button.
The matching rubric items can be selected per category in the rubric. Selecting other rubric items will
automatically update the grade, this is linear to the points of the rubric.

.. warning:: Alterations in the rubric have to be manually saved with the 'submit' button (unless the ``incremental_rubric_submission`` config setting is enabled).

General feedback and grade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A final grade can be given using the input field underneath the Codeviewer.

.. note:: The grade generated with the rubric can be overwritten.

Additional general feedback can be given with the menu found under the :fa:`pencil-square-o` button.

Grade History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A detailed overview of the previous grades to the current submission can be found under the
:fa:`history` button. This overviews specifies the grade, grader, date and time and whether this
grade was automatically generated from the rubric. Students can normally not see the grade history overview.

.. note:: Each individual revision of the rubric will add a new entry in the grade history overview.


Download feedback or assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is sometimes necessary to manually download the submission or its feedback. These can both be
separately downloaded using the :fa:`download` button. The assignment can be downloaded as archive.
An overview of all feedback, including line feedback, linter comments and general grade and feedback can be download as
plain text file.

.. note:: Make sure pop-ups from CodeGrade are allowed in your browser if downloading fails.
.. note:: Although it is possible to manually download individual submissions, we recommend using the filesystem.

Deleting a submission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CodeGrade offers the functionality to remove submissions, this can be done using the red :fa:`times` button.

.. warning:: Deleting a submission will result in effectively removing all information about the submission (including plagiarism results) and is irreversible!


Codeviewer for Students
-------------------------
Handed in programming assignments can be displayed using CodeGrade's Codeviewer. The Codeviewer in essence
provides an overview of your handed in files and the feedback gotten.

If the assignment is finished and graded, the overview page is initially displayed. This page provides an overview of
all line feedback given, and all files changed or added by your teacher to make your program work. All feedback or changes
are presented with a block of code around it to add context. To toggle the overview mode and go back to the file browser, use the
:fa:`binoculars` button.

The final grade is displayed on the bottom of the screen, if available.
If a rubric is available for the assignment it can be found under the :fa:`th` button, next to this final grade.
Further general feedback can be displayed using the :fa:`pencil-square-o` button. An overview of all feedback,
including line feedback, linter comments and general grade and feedback can be download as
plain text file under the :fa:`download` button.

Settings Tab
--------------------
The Codeviewer settings can be found under the :fa:`cog` button. And allows for configuring:

* Whitespace characters' visibility.
* Programming language and its corresponding highlighting (usually should be left default).
* Font size of the text in the Codeviewer.
* Theme to light or dark.

.. note:: The font and theme settings are saved site-wide and can also be set on the Profile page.
