This project is a spin-off from the UvA (University of Amsterdam). Current grading tools focus on classic writing assignments. With CodeGra.de one can grade code line by line, apply linters over the code, add feedback shortcuts, and much more all in an intuitive interface. CodeGrade is the first grading tool that started with code in mind. CodeGrade is also integrated with LTI in online learning environments such as Canvas or Blackboard.

Workflows
---

- ### Student: ###
  A student can submit his/her assignments by uploading a single .tar.gz/.tar/.zip which contains the code, and maybe a PDF.
  - upload tar
  - get feedback line by line

- ### Teacher: ###
The basic idea for teachers is that they, or teaching assistants can add assignments to existing courses and grade them once submitted by students. While grading you can click on individual lines of code and add direct inline feedback to them. From the courses page CodeGrade  lets you easily devide submissions ready for grading over all, or some, TA's by clicking on 'manage course'. From here you can click on the assignment and a dropdown menu will apear where you can determine which TA's you want do devinde between -insert gif of course dropdown menu-. Devision is done randomly and assigned submissions can always be reassigned. In the previously mentioned drop down menu you can also run linters on all submissions. Linter errors will show up in the submissions as a red linenumber -insert screenshot of assignment with linter error+popup text-. Once assigned a TA can switch between viewing all submissions and all submissions assigned to him or her. While grading an assignment, you switch to next or previous submission as well as select any submission from a dropdown menu. You can also return to the submission page. From here you can export the table with (graded) submissions as a csv file. A hand full of extra options are available for this feature -insert gif of export menu-.
