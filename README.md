# CodeGrade
CodeGrade is a feedback and grading platform designed for programming
education. It makes grading and handing in programming exercises more insightful
and effective for students and more efficient for teachers. Where programming
exercises are currently reviewed in a classical and counter-intuitive way,
resulting in only little and vague feedback, CodeGrade creates the missing
intuitive environment for reviewing programming exercises.

This is achieved using some of the key-features CodeGrade provides:
- Inline feedback making it possible to write feedback for a
  specific part of the code.
- Rubrics per assignment to make grading more consistent and help students with
  understanding their grade.
- Built-in code plagiarism detection system using JPlag.
- CodeGrade AutoTest, our highly flexible and scalable feedback focused
  automatic grading system, allowing students to get feedback immediately and
  continuously.
- [CodeGrade Filesystem](#codegrade-filesystem) enabling both students and
  teachers to access and hand in files on the CodeGrade system locally without
  any overhead.
- [CodeGrade editor plugins](#codegrade-editor-plugins) allowing the teacher to
  locally review programming assignments and fill in rubrics using the editor of
  choice.

## Getting Started
CodeGrade is offered as Software as a Service, please consult our
[website](https://codegra.de) to learn how to get started.

A local installation of CodeGrade can be created using the running instructions
in the [CodeGrade
documentation](https://docs.codegra.de/running.html). CodeGrade can be run in
both development mode and production mode, both are explained in the
documentation.

### CodeGrade filesystem
The CodeGrade filesystem (or _CodeGra.fs_) can be used to mount a local
CodeGrade instance on your computer to browse the assignments and files on the
server. The filesystem can be used for students to locally work on the CodeGrade
mount and thus automatically _hand in_ the assignment with each save. For
teachers the filesystem can be used to grade work without any overhead locally
using a preferred supported editor.

More information on installing and using the CodeGrade filesystem can be found
on <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.fs>.

#### CodeGrade editor plugins
Accompanying the CodeGrade filesystem are editor plugins. These plugins
allow for easy and intuitive grading of work locally in your favourite
editor. By using the combination of the filesystem and an editor plugin,
overhead during grading can be reduced to a bare minimum and all focus can be on
the actual grading of the work.

As of writing, there are editor plugins for the following editors:
* [Vim (CodeGra.vim)](https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.vim)
* [Atom (CodeGra.atom)](https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.atom)
* [Emacs (CodeGra.el)](https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.el)

## Technologies used
* [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) - A front-end JavaScript UI framework
  used to create CodeGrade's front-end.
* [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) - A python back-end WSGI framework
  used to create CodeGrade's back-end.
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) - The database used for
  CodeGrade.
* [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) - Celery is used to provide a non
  blocking background queue.

innovating your programming education by using CodeGrade at your institution.

### History
CodeGrade originated as project, called _CodeGra.de_, in the Project Software
Engineering course at the University of Amsterdam in June 2017. The project
emerged from our own frustrations as both students and teaching assistants in
computer science at the UvA. As students we lacked meaningful feedback to
give us insight in our grade for programming assignments. And as teaching
assistants the amount of overhead required to actually grade programming
assignments in the traditional way, in addition to the lack of providing useful
feedback in a counter-intuitive environment made the work very frustrating at
times. This still drives us to create a product that can revolutionise
programming education to this date.
### Acknowledgements
The initial version of CodeGrade was created for a course at the University of
Amsterdam and was developed by _Leon Bartelsman_, _Ewoud Bouman_, _Harm van
Eekeren_, _Wicher Heldring_, _Devin Hillenius_, _Niek Kabel_, _Erik Kooistra_,
_Olmo Kramer_, _Sebastian Melzer_, _Thomas Schaper_, _Bram Snijders_ and _Youri
Voet_.

Furthermore, we want to thank the University of Amsterdam for their support of
this project during its first year of development.
