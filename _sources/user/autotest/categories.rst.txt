Categories
==============

Within a :ref:`level <autotest-levels>` you can create a Category. Each Category
has to be connected to a Rubric Category. By doing this, AutoTest is
feedback oriented. We encourage teachers to create meaningful Rubric Categories
and think about how to group their tests accordingly. By grouping tests into
AutoTest Categories that are connected to a Rubric Category, this also means
that students know where tests belong and how they got their grade for an
assignment.

Setup
------------------------------

Press the **Add Category** button inside a level to create a new Category within
your AutoTest configuration.

Firstly, select the Rubric Category you want to connect it to.

.. note::
    Make sure to create your Rubric Categories before creating your AutoTest
    Categories.

Next, you can add tests to this category. You have several different types of
tests you can add to this.

- **IO Tests** for simple input/output tests.
- **Run Program Tests** to run a program and check if the program exited successfully.
- **Capture Points Tests** to run a custom test program (such as a unit test) which captures a number between 0 and 1 and converts this to an amount of points.
- **Check Points**, which check if the percentage of points gotten before this special test is high enough to continue with the tests after the Check Points test. This makes it possible to have certain tests only execute if tests before it were successful.

Running
--------------------

When AutoTest is executed, each Category starts with a fresh snapshot of the
environment setup. This means that Categories run independently of each other.
Tests within the Category are executed in order.
